Welcome to the Hyra API reference! Here we document all of our APIs and the versions of our APIs. You'll need to implicitly use the API version you desire, by using the version reference in the URL of the API. 

Make sure you're using the right version, as various versions of our API have different features. For more information on our API version, check out our API Changelog.

To change your API version, simply select the API version of your choice from the dropdown under the Hyra logo, see below.

Code examples are provided for each API route. We provide examples in Curl, Javascript and Roblox Lua. When contacting an API, please see the required parameters and headers for your request, as these will need to be attached for the request to be handled by our systems.

If you're looking for information on how to use Hyra products, you can visit our [Product Support Centre](https://support.hyra.work).

If you find any issues in our documentation, please report corrections and improvements to our API Team via email at [apis@hyra.work](mailto:apis@hyra.work)
