# Purchasing credits

Credits can be purchased using Credit or Debit Cards or via PayPal. We grant our merchant partners, Paddle the right to sell access to our platform on our behalf, so any disputes or billing questions should be raised with [Paddle](https://paddle.net). Hyra does not directly handle payments. 

Please be aware that if you are eligible for tax, you will be charged tax on top of the standard pricing.

Each Credit costs **$0.000005** and is purchased before used as part of a top up.

Most groups purchase **600,000** credits per month, bringing their total cost per month to **$3.00**. This will then allow them to rank 150,000 users a month if they are using the credits for ranking.

You can see your usage and how many credits you have left over on our Developer Hub. 

## Frequently asked questions

### What happens to my unused monthly credit?

Your unused monthly credit will disappear when your monthly contract rolls. 

### Is there a minimum top-up amount?

The minimum amount you can top-up by in any single transaction is **200,000 credits.** This totals at $1.00. 

### Can I purchase using a prepaid Visa or Mastercard card?

Yes, if your prepaid card supports online card transactions, you absolutely can use a prepaid card.

### My payment was declined. Why?

There are several reasons why your payment can be declined with us. We've outlined some of the most common.

* **Do not honour** - This happens when your issuer declines your card for an unknown reason. We do not hold the reason and you'll need to contact your issuer, bank or institution for more information.
* **Insufficient funds** - This happens when your card likely does not have enough money on to make the transaction.
* **Disallowed transaction** - This happens when your issuer declines the transaction. The most common reason for this is due to the payment being international. Please contact your issuer, bank or institution for more information.
* **Pickup card** - This happens when your card has been lost or stolen and the card you are attempting to the make the payment on has been flagged by your bank.
* **CVC does not match** - This happens when the entered CVC or CVV does not match the CVC or CVV on the card.
* **High risk level** - This happens when there is a high level of risk with a card payment, so we've declined it to keep the cardholder safe. This may happen if you're using a VPN or a suspicious device to make your payment.

### Can I pay using Robux?

We do not accept Robux. Sorry.

### Can I pay using an iTunes, Amazon, Hulu, Netflix, Discord or other gift card?

We do not accept gift cards. Sorry.

### Can I pay after I've used the credit?

To prevent fraud, you must pay before you can use the credits. If you would like to auto top-up your credits, you can enable that and we will bill your card each time you fall $1.00 below a certain amount of credits.
