# HTTPS only

When making a request, please use the secure ðŸ”’ HTTPS variant. Requests sent via non-secure HTTP will be automatically upgraded to HTTPS, so please send them as HTTPS when invoking the endpoints, as using HTTP may flag unexpected results depending on how you are accessing the API. 

We require HTTPS to ensure that all data can not be intercepted mid-flight. If your request system does not support HTTPS, we are unable to offer an alternative.
